## About The Project

<p>Second challenge project.<br>
Building responsive layouts for mobile and desktop.
The biggest challenge was the way to think about how to fit the section inside the main and how to use @media queries</p>
<br><br>Your users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

<br>
<br> <p>I don't have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Media Queries

## What I learned

Very easy project for someone who recently stepped in the world of development!

## Useful resources

1. <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> - Used to query some html and css properties.
